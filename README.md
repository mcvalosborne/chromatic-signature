# Chromatic Signature — Discover Your Colors 🎨

An interactive, personality-based color palette generator that creates a **unique chromatic signature** for every user. Each palette is algorithmically generated based on your responses to philosophical questions about consciousness, time, and the nature of your inner world.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Infinite Unique Palettes** — No two users get exactly the same colors, even with identical answers
- **Philosophical Questions** — Deep, introspective prompts about consciousness, time, and inner truth
- **Algorithmic Color Generation** — HSL-based color science creates harmonious triadic & analogous palettes
- **Procedural Naming** — Dynamic name generation creates unique, evocative palette titles
- **Personal Color Stories** — AI-generated narratives based on your responses
- **Save & Share** — Download your palette as a high-resolution PNG

## 🚀 Quick Start

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

No build step, no dependencies, no server required!

## 🔮 The 5 Questions

1. **Consciousness Shape** — Is your awareness expanding or contracting?
2. **Nature of Time** — Does time feel like a river or a sculpture?
3. **Quality of Silence** — Electric stillness or velvet darkness?
4. **Light vs Shadow** — Would your deepest truth appear as light or shadow?
5. **Soul Texture** — Is your essence more like fire or water?

## 🎨 How Colors Are Generated

The algorithm uses your answers as seeds for a **continuous color spectrum**, not discrete buckets:

| Answer | Color Influence |
|--------|-----------------|
| Q1: Expanding | Warm hues, higher saturation |
| Q1: Contracting | Cool hues, softer tones |
| Q2: River | Variable lightness |
| Q2: Sculpture | Stable, bright lightness |
| Q3: Electric | Higher contrast, vivid |
| Q3: Velvet | Deeper, muted tones |
| Q4: Light | Warm rotation, brighter |
| Q4: Shadow | Cool rotation, deeper |
| Q5: Fire | Triadic harmony |
| Q5: Water | Analogous harmony |

Each palette includes micro-variations based on timestamp, ensuring **infinite uniqueness**.
